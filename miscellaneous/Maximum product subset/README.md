# Problem Statement 
`Maximum product subset`

Given an integer array, find the maximum product of its elements among all its subsets.

## Example:


Input: [-6, 4, -5, 8, -10, 0, 8 ]

Output: The maximum product of a subset is 15360
The subset with the maximum product of its elements is { -6, 4, 8, -10, 8 }
 
 
Input: [4, -8, 0, 8]
 
Output: The maximum product of a subset is 32 
The subset with the maximum product of its elements is { 4, 8 }


# Approach:

`Greedy Algorithm
