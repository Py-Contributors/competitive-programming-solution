# Problem Statement

`Sum of Areas of Rectangles possible for an array`

## Example

Input: `[10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 10, 11, 10]`

Output: `210`

Explanation: 
We can form two rectangles one square (10 * 10) 
and one (11 * 10). Hence, total area = 100 + 110 = 210.

Input: `[3, 4, 5, 6 ]`

Output: `15`

Explanation: 
We can reduce 4 to 3 and 6 to 5 so that we got 
rectangle of (3 * 5). Hence area = 15.
