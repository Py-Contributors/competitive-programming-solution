# Fibonacci Sequence

A fibonacci series is the sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

For example, `0, 1, 1, 2, 3`. 

Here, each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

# Solving the problem

Dynamic programming works by storing the result of subproblems
 so that when their solutions are required, they are at hand and we do not need to recalculate them.

This technique of storing the value of subproblems is called memoization. 
By saving the values in the array, 
we save time for computations of sub-problems we have already come across.
