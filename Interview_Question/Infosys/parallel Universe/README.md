# Problem Statement

`Parallel Universe`

## Description

In a parallel universe, there are `N` planets where each planet has arr[i] residents.

The residents of the universe want to make the number of the residents for all the planets equal.

However the residents of this universe are superstitious and will only allow you to walk in a strick clockwise or counterclockwise direction when fixing the number of residents in a plant.

The cost of relocating each resident is the distance you transport that resident until you deliver the resident to the desired planet.

you are asked to find the minimum cost of relocating all the residents to the desired planet to make the population of all the planets equal.


## Example

### Test Case 1:

N = 4 number of planets
arr = [8, 4, 0, 4] number of residents in each planet.

Output: 8

### Test Case 2:

N = 4 number of planets
arr = [0, 40, 0, 0] number of residents in each planet.

Output: 60
